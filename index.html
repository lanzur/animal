                <p>The black-footed cat (Felis nigripes), also called small-spotted cat, is the smallest African cat and endemic to the southwestern arid zone of Southern Africa. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2002, as the population is suspected to be declining due to bushmeat poaching of prey species, persecution, traffic accidents and predation by domestic animals.</p>

             <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
                <p>Felis nigripes was the scientific name proposed by William John Burchell in 1824 who described cat skins used by ethnic people for making cloaks.Felis (Microfelis) nigripes thomasi was proposed as a subspecies by Guy C. Shortridge in 1931 who described skins collected in Griqualand West as being darker.The existence of subspecies was questioned, as no geographical or ecological barriers between populations exist.Today, the black-footed cat is considered a monotypic species.The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic relationships of black-footed cat and other species within the Felis lineage.</p>

                    <p>The black-footed cat is the smallest wild cat in Africa and rivals the rusty-spotted cat as the world's smallest wild cat. Males reach a head-to-body length of 36.7 to 43.3 cm with tails 16.4 to 19.8 cm long. Females are smaller with a maximum head-to-body-length of 36.9 cm and tails 12.6 to 17.0 cm long.Adult resident males weigh on average 1.9 kg and a maximum of 2.45 kg. Adult resident females weigh on average 1.3 kg and a maximum of 1.65 kg.The shoulder height is about 25 cm.</p>

                    <p>Despite its name, only the pads and underparts of the cat's feet are black. The cat has a stocky build with rounded ears, large eyes, and short black-tipped tail.These patterns provide the animals with camouflage; the backs of their ears, however, are the same color as the background color of their fur. They have six mammae, and unlike other spotted cats, non-pigmented skin.</p>

            <h2>Ecology and Behavior</h2>
                <div class="two_col">
                <p>Black-footed cats are solitary and strictly nocturnal animals, thus rarely seen. They spend the day resting in dense cover in unoccupied burrows of springhares, porcupines, and aardvarks, or in hollow termite mounds. They emerge to hunt after sunset.They are typically found in dry, open habitat with some degree of vegetation cover. Apparently they get all the moisture they need from their prey, but will drink water when available.</p>

            <div class="two_col">
                <p>Unlike most other cats, black-footed cats are poor climbers, and will generally ignore tree branches. Their stocky bodies and short tails are not conducive to tree-climbing. They dig vigorously in the sand to extend or modify burrows for shelter.Black-footed cats are highly unsociable animals that seek refuge at the slightest disturbance. When cornered, they are known to defend themselves fiercely. Due to this habit and their courage, they are called miershooptier (anthill tiger in Afrikaans) in parts of the South African Karoo. They rarely use termite mounds for cover or for bearing their young.</p>

                <p>A San legend claims that a black-footed cat can kill a giraffe by piercing its jugular. This exaggeration is intended to emphasize the bravery and tenacity of the animal. The only times their solitary behavior changes is during breeding season, and among females with dependent kittens.A female roams in an average home range of 10 km2 in a year, and a resident male of 22 km2. The range of an adult male overlaps the ranges of one to four females. On average, an adult animal travels 8 km per night in search of prey.</p>

                <p>The cats use scent marking throughout their ranges, with males spraying urine up to twelve times an hour. Other forms of scent marking include rubbing objects, raking with claws, and depositing faeces in visible locations. Their calls are louder than those of other cats of their size, presumably to allow them to call over relatively large distances. When close to each other, however, they use quieter purrs or gurgles, or hiss and growl if threatened.</p>

                <h3>Threats</h3>
                    <p>Known threats include methods of indiscriminate predator control, such as bait poisoning and steel-jaw traps, habitat deterioration from overgrazing, intraguild predation, diseases, declining springhare (Pedetes capensis) populations and unsuitable farming practices. Distribution data indicate that the majority of protected areas may be too small to adequately conserve viable sub-populations.</p>
                <h3>Conservation</h3>
                <div class="two_col">
                    <p>Felis nigripes is included on CITES Appendix I and protected by national legislation across most of its range. Hunting is banned in Botswana and South Africa.The Black-footed Cat Working Group carries out a research project at Benfontein Nature Reserve and Nuwejaarsfontein Farm near Kimberley, Northern Cape, where seven black-footed cats have been radio-collared. This project is part of a multidisciplinary effort to study the distribution, ecology, health, and reproduction of black-footed cats over an extended period. In November 2012, this project was extended to Biesiesfontein Farm located in the Victoria West area. Camera traps are used in the research to monitor the behaviour of radio-collared black-footed cats, and their interaction with aardwolves (Proteles cristatus).</p>

                    <p>Wuppertal Zoo acquired black-footed cats as long ago as 1957, and succeeded in breeding them in 1963. In 1993, the European Endangered Species Programme was formed to coordinate which animals are best suited for pairing to maintain genetic diversity and to avoid inbreeding. The International Studbook for the black-footed cat is kept in the Wuppertal Zoo in Germany. As of July 2011, detailed records exist for a total of 726 captive cats since 1964; worldwide, 74 individuals were kept in 23 institutions in Germany, United Arab Emirates, USA, UK, and South Africa.A range of zoos have reported breeding successes, including the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, Fresno Chaffee Zoo,[23] the Brookfield Zoo and Philadelphia Zoo. </p>
